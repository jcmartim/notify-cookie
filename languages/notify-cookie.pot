"The idea is to notify users of the site, in an easy way, that some data is "
"collected, through cookies, so that you guarantee that your website, is in "
"accordance with the laws of the European Union when it is visited by a user "
"from the region . I know that there are several plugins that are much more "
"complex than this one, but as I said, the idea was to do something simple "
"and practical. This will not consume large resources of the site and will do "
"the job!"

"the button again."
