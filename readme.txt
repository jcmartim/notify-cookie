Simple notification of the use of cookies to website users in order to comply with European Union laws.

== Description ==
The idea is to notify users of the website, with ease, that some data is collected, through \"cookies\", so that you can ensure that your website complies with European Union laws when it is visited by a user in the region. I know that there are several plugins that are much more complex than this one, but as I said, the idea was to do something simple and practical. It doesn\'t consume a lot of website resources, and it does the job!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Does this plugin open a notification tab?
Yes, this plugin shows at the bottom of the user\'s screen a notification with a proceed button that when clicked causes the notification to disappear.

Does the notification appear on all pages?
Yes, until the Continue button is clicked.

If I leave the site and come back, will the notification persist?
No, unless the browser is closed and opened again. Because, when clicking on the next button, information about the localSorage of the browser is recorded, thus ensuring that the notification does not appear at all times.

Is it possible to customize the notification message?
Yes, through the plugin settings page in the Settings → Notify Cookie menu.

Do I need to link to the Privacy Policy page?
Yes, it is necessary to complement the notification and show the user the privacy policies of the website.
